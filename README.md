# i-ruma static site

This repository contains the static files for the i-ruma site (source directory).

Quick steps to publish with GitHub Pages:

1. Create a repository on GitHub (via website or `gh repo create`).
2. Add remote and push:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/REPO.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

3. In the GitHub repo settings -> Pages, select branch `main` (or `gh-pages`) and root `/`.

Or use Netlify / Vercel for drag-and-drop or CLI-based deployments.

If you want me to create the remote and push for you, tell me whether you have the `gh` CLI installed and authenticated, or provide the remote URL.
